# Wallet-service

A bitcoin wallet based heavily off of `bitcore-wallet-client` and `bitcore-wallet`. This is a work in progress but allows for an easy way to include the bitcore libraries as well as functionality for a bitcoin wallet in nodejs client or server side.

To run, first startup the `bitcore-wallet-service`:
```
cd /node_modules/bitcore-wallet-service
npm start
```
